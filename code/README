Runs Prisoner's Dilemma experiments and other tournament games.
The simple command-line interface to run the experiment is as follows:

python main.py {player} [evoltype] [cc] [cd] [dd] [dc]

The attributes in {} are required attributes, the [] attributes are
optional.

For {player}, you can run Prisoner's Dilemma with player types
'simple', 'nmoves' (which store 1 move and n moves respectively, default
is n = 4), or 'mixed', to run a tournament with a combination of these
players, or a Blotto tournament with 'blotto' as the argument.

The attribute [evoltype] is optional, defaulting to SimpleEvolution if no
argument is specified. This argument can take type 'simpleevol' for
SimpleEvolution, 'simplesex' for SimpleSex, and 'complex' for ComplexSex.
The [evoltype] argument cannot be used with 'mixed' and 'blotto'.

The [cc], [cd], [cd], [dd] arguments are for the payoff matrix in the
Prisoner's Dilemma. Basically, 'c' stands for 'cooperate' and 'd' stands
for 'defect', and the argument specifies the payoff if you make the decision
specified by the first letter and the other player makes the decision
specified by the second letter.
